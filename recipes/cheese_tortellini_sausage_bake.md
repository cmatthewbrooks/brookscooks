# Cheesy Tortellini and Sausage Bake

## Introduction

I needed something new for date night one week and found this online. It's definitely
comfort food, which helps during a Wisconsin winter.

## Recipe

### Ingredients

* Cheese tortellini (1 package, 9 oz)
* Italian sausage (1 lb)
* Onions, finely chopped (½ cup)
* Tomato sauce (3 cups, 24 oz)
* Mozzarella cheese, shredded (1 cup)
* Parmesan cheese, grated (2 tbsp)
* Fresh parsley, finely chopped (¼ cup)
* Olive oil, salt, pepper for seasoning

### Instructions

#### Prep

* Preheat oven to 350F (175C)
* Cook tortellini according to package instructions
* Chop onions

#### Cook

* Brown sausage in cast-iron or oven safe skillet, breaking down into smaller pieces
* Add onions and cook until soft/fragrant
* Add tomato sauce and bring to simmer for 5 - 10 inutes
* Stir in tortellini, top with shredded mozzarella and parsley, then bake for 10 - 15 minutes
  until everything is melted together
* Let stand for 5 minutes before serving

#### Serve

* Serve in pasta bowls with grated parmesan and a parsley garnish

### Notes/Thoughts

* This is still fine to make in a pinch without mozzarella or parsley.
* Recipe could probably double in a slightly larger shallow sauce pan.
