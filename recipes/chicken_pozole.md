# Chicken Pozole

## Introduction

I had this for the first time during a long-distance sailing race. The flavors were great
and it was my first time experiencing [hominy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominy). After
trying the soup, I knew I wanted it to be something in my reportoire. This is currently a
base recipe on which to iterate.
