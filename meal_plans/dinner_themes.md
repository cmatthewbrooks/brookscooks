# Dinner Themes

The following themes can help spawn schedule ideas for dinner for each night of the
week, reducing how frequently we need to start from the question "What's for
dinner?"

## Monday

* Mediterranean Monday - anything Mediterranean is a great way to start the week
* Meatless Monday - cooking vegetarian is nice variety
* Mexican Monday - Mexican food never disappoints
* Meal prep Monday - Kick off the week by preparing healthy meals in advance, 
    perfect for busy days ahead.

## Tuesday

* Taco Tuesday - tacos are always fun...and don't have to be traditional. Greek or
    Asian fusion can be fun.
* Try-it-out Tuesday - With Monday out of the way, Tuesday can be a bit more relaxed
    to try out a new recipe.

## Wednesday

* Worldly Wednesday - anything international can work here - Asian, Mexican, Greek, etc.
* Wacky Wednesday - Breakfast for dinner, anyone?
* Whatever Wednesday - pull something from the freezer

## Thursday

* Take-out Thursday - by the time we've made it this far in the week, take-out is okay

## Friday

* Fancy Friday - if it's been a good week, getting fancy can feel like the right way to
    close it out. Red meat and red wine never disappoints.
* Friday-night Fish - any fish-based recipe works, from something healthy and salmon-based
    to a proper Wisconsin-style Friday night fish fry.
* Fajita Friday - an easy favorite.

## Saturday and Sunday

* Seasonal Saturday/Sundays - Focus on using seasonal ingredients and highlighting recipes that 
    incorporate fresh produce.
    * Thanks GPT4All/Llama3.
* Slow Cooking Saturdays/Sundays: Let your slow cooker do the work for you by preparing a meal 
    in advance and enjoying it later.
* Soup and Sandwich Saturday/Sunday - this can be comforting and might also yield leftovers to
    get Monday started.
