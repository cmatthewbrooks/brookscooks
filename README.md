# Brooks Cooks

My personal space for meal planning and recipes

## Motivation

I love to cook (and eat!) but meal planning still causes friction in my daily
routines. This repository aims to help solve the following problems:

* Recipe sharing - I want to be able to share recipes with friends and family
without having to send them to one of the many awful food blogger sites. It's
unclear to me how food blogs all ended up equally irritating, but they did. While
I still find myself needing to visit such sites sometimes, I want to pull from them 
what I want at that moment then reduce or eliminate my future visits.
* Food blogging - Sometimes I'd be interested in sharing content about food-related
topics. I don't care about newsletters or tracking engagement or affiliate links, so I'd
just rather share a cleanly-formatted markdown post.
* AI/LLMs - I'm a tech worker and large language models (such as those that power ChatGPT)
get more impressive by the day. I had early success getting ChatGPT to help me with simple
meal plans and providing outputs in formats I wanted. As I use local models more and more,
I want to have a local repository where locally-running LLMs can use my previous meal plans
and recipe preferences to help me meal plan.
